        I still remember the first time I tried Sushi… I think I was incredibly
        late to the party. I was 18 and in my first year of university, Mark & I
        went to Yo! Sushi within Selfridges in Manchester. I loved all the
        flavours, the colour, the vibe that comes with grabbing plates at will
        off a moving belt, basically from that day forward sushi & I have had a
        pretty decent relationship! <n />

        variety of different sushi restaurants, I’ve mainly just enjoyed the
        likes of Yo! Sushi, Itsu & Wasabi. I’ve always wanted to go to a really
        nice Japanese restaurant or maybe just visit Japan someday? But for now
        Mark & I have started to fulfil our sushi desires by making our own at
        home! It really is very simple & a lot of fun too! There are so many
        different types of sushi, but in the case of today’s post I thought I
        would put down my method for making some sushi rolls. We usually make a
        mix of maki (the smaller sushi rolls), sushi rolls & the inside out
        sushi rolls. Of course, once you have prepared your sushi rice the world
        really is your oyster, & you could attempt to make any type of sushi you
        like. For instance the sushi I refer to as ‘Nigiri’ is very
        straightforward to make & doesn’t require the rolling up… however making
        the gluten free sushi rolls in the most fun!

        fillings and flavours you have with your sushi is completely up to you.
        For Mark & I when we are making gluten free sushi rolls at home we often
        have: Avocado & Salmon (on the whole we always use smoked salmon, it
        tastes great & we often have it in the fridge anyway!) Prawn & Avocado
        Gluten Free Katsu Curry Sauce & Chicken (we usually make these the day
        after we have made my Gluten Free Katsu Curry for dinner & use the
        leftovers. The sauce is easy to make & then you just need some cold
        gluten free breaded chicken.) Tuna Mayo & Cucumber (super simple – super
        delicious!)
